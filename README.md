Composite Shear Walls systems are being considered and designed as an alternative to conventional reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls and core wall structures. Similar to RC walls, composite walls provide lateral load resistance to the building structure. In nonseismic design, composite wall systems provide the stiffness and strength needed to resist lateral forces resulting from wind loading.
